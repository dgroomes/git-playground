ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Git.

---

This repository captures a _small_ amount of my personal notes, materials references, and code snippets about the Git
version control system.

## Notes

My personal favorite way to learn Git is to read the excellent _Pro Git_ book which is available to read online for free
at <https://git-scm.com/book/ru/v2>. I personally read it via <https://learning.oreilly.com/> or the O'Reilly app
because I have an O'Reilly subscription. 

## Submodules

I would like to learn [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). So, let's pick a project to
add to our Git repo as a submodule. Let's pick my own repo <https://github.com/dgroomes/dgroomes>. I added this
submodule by executing this command:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dgroomes/dgroomes
``` 

The repository is now under the directory `dgroomes/`.
